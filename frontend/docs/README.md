## What is Weekend Planner?

Weekend Planner is an AI-powered tool that helps you plan the perfect family weekend activities. Simply tell it where you are, when your weekend is, and (optionally) your children's ages and activity preferences — and let the AI do the rest!

Here's what makes Weekend Planner special:

- **Weather-Aware Recommendations**: The app checks the weather forecast for your area and adjusts its suggestions accordingly. If the weather looks great, you'll get outdoor activity ideas. If it's looking stormy, you'll receive cozy indoor alternatives.

- **Personalized for Your Family**: When you provide your children's ages, the AI tailors its recommendations to activities that are age-appropriate and engaging for everyone.

- **Comprehensive Activity Search**: Weekend Planner searches for:
  - **Local Activities** — Community events, parks, museums, and family-friendly attractions near you
  - **Special Events** — Festivals, fairs, concerts, and seasonal happenings in your area
  - **Home Activities** — Creative indoor projects and activities for when the weather keeps you inside
