ERROR STATE SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER
================================================================================
File: error-state.png
Location: frontend/docs/images/

This file serves as a placeholder and capture guide for documentation
maintainers who will create the actual error-state.png screenshot.

================================================================================
1. FILE PURPOSE
================================================================================

This screenshot documents the error state of the Weekend Planner application.
It shows users what to expect when something goes wrong, helping them
understand error messages and know what actions they can take.

The error-state.png image should display the ErrorDisplay component in action,
showcasing the user-friendly error message design and the expandable
technical details section.

================================================================================
2. SCREENSHOT CAPTURE INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

Follow these steps to capture the error state screenshot:

Step 1: Ensure the Frontend is Running
   - Navigate to the frontend directory
   - Run: npm run dev
   - Confirm the application loads at http://localhost:5173

Step 2: STOP the Backend Server
   - If the ADK backend is running (via "adk web"), stop it
   - This simulates a connection failure scenario
   - Alternatively, disconnect from the network temporarily

Step 3: Fill Out the Form
   - Enter a valid location (e.g., "San Francisco" or "94102")
   - Select a valid start date (e.g., upcoming Saturday)
   - Select a valid end date (same or later date)
   - Optionally add kids ages and preferences

Step 4: Trigger the Error
   - Click the "Generate Plan" button
   - Wait for the request to fail (may take a few seconds)
   - The error display component should appear in the output panel

Step 5: Capture the Screenshot
   - Ensure the complete error card is visible
   - The "Technical Details" section can be collapsed OR expanded
   - Capture using browser screenshot tools or system screenshot

================================================================================
3. EXPECTED ERROR MESSAGE
================================================================================

The primary error message should read:

   "Couldn't reach the backend. Make sure the ADK server is running
   with `adk web`"

This is the user-friendly message that guides users toward the solution.

Other possible error messages that could be captured:
   - "Something went wrong on the server. Please try again."
   - "Request timed out. Please try again."
   - "Connection blocked. See README for proxy setup."

Choose the backend connection error for the primary documentation screenshot
as it represents the most common user issue.

================================================================================
4. VISUAL ELEMENTS TO INCLUDE
================================================================================

The screenshot MUST show the following elements:

Error Card Container:
   [ ] Red-bordered card indicating error state
   [ ] Uses error color accents (#E63946 - muted red)
   [ ] Rounded corners (rounded-xl / 12px border radius)
   [ ] Clear visual distinction from success state

Error Icon or Indicator:
   [ ] Warning icon or error symbol
   [ ] Positioned prominently near the message
   [ ] Uses error color (#E63946)

User-Friendly Error Message:
   [ ] Main error text clearly visible and readable
   [ ] Non-technical language explaining the issue
   [ ] Suggested action (run "adk web" command)

Technical Details Section:
   [ ] "Technical Details" label/heading visible
   [ ] Expandable/collapsible indicator (arrow or chevron)
   [ ] Can show collapsed or expanded state
   [ ] If expanded: shows status code, raw error body

Retry Button (if applicable):
   [ ] Button to retry the failed request
   [ ] Clear call-to-action styling

================================================================================
5. TECHNICAL DETAILS - EXPANDED VIEW (OPTIONAL)
================================================================================

If you choose to capture the expanded technical details view, it should show:

   - HTTP Status Code (if applicable, e.g., "Status: 0" for network failure)
   - Error type or name
   - Raw error message or body content
   - Timestamp of when error occurred

This gives technically-inclined users information for troubleshooting.

================================================================================
6. LAYOUT CONTEXT
================================================================================

Desktop View (Recommended for Primary Screenshot):
   - Browser window width: 1200px
   - Two-column layout visible:
     * Left column (40%): Input form with filled data
     * Right column (60%): Error display component
   - Both columns should be visible in screenshot

Mobile View (Optional Alternative):
   - Browser window width: 768px or less
   - Single-column stacked layout
   - Form above, error display below

Include enough context to show:
   - The form data that was submitted
   - The clear error response in the output area
   - Application header if space permits

================================================================================
7. RECOMMENDED BROWSER SETTINGS
================================================================================

Before capturing, configure your browser as follows:

Browser Choice:
   - Chrome (preferred for consistent rendering)
   - Firefox, Safari, or Edge also acceptable

Window Configuration:
   - Width: 1200px for desktop view
   - Height: 800px minimum to avoid scrolling
   - Zoom level: 100%

Preparation Steps:
   - Clear browser cache and cookies
   - Use incognito/private browsing mode for clean state
   - Disable browser extensions that may affect styling
   - Set system to light mode (unless dark mode is documented)

DevTools (if needed):
   - Use Device Toolbar to set exact viewport size
   - Toggle device emulation off for true desktop view
   - Network tab can verify backend is unreachable

================================================================================
8. FILE NAMING AND FORMAT
================================================================================

File Name: error-state.png

Format Requirements:
   - File type: PNG (preferred for UI screenshots)
   - Color depth: 24-bit or 32-bit with transparency
   - Transparency: Include if background has rounded corners

Resolution Guidelines:
   - Standard resolution: 1200 x 800 pixels minimum
   - Retina/HiDPI: 2400 x 1600 pixels (2x scale) recommended
   - Ensure text remains crisp and readable when scaled

Compression:
   - Optimize file size while maintaining quality
   - Target: Under 500KB for web performance
   - Tools: ImageOptim, TinyPNG, or similar

================================================================================
9. REFERENCE IN DOCUMENTATION
================================================================================

This screenshot is referenced in the following documentation files:

user-guide.md:
   - Section: "Handling Errors"
   - Context: Shows users what error state looks like
   - Purpose: Help users recognize and respond to errors

troubleshooting.md:
   - Section: "Connection Problems"
   - Context: Visual reference for backend connection issues
   - Purpose: Guide users through resolving common errors

docs/README.md:
   - Section: "Screenshots" (if screenshot gallery included)
   - Context: Overview of available documentation images

================================================================================
10. ALTERNATIVE ERROR SCENARIOS
================================================================================

While the primary screenshot shows backend connection failure, consider
capturing additional error states for comprehensive documentation:

Server Error (500):
   - Message: "Something went wrong on the server. Please try again."
   - How to trigger: Backend must return 500 status (requires backend modification)

Request Timeout:
   - Message: "Request timed out. Please try again."
   - How to trigger: Slow network or backend takes >30 seconds to respond

CORS Error:
   - Message: "Connection blocked. See README for proxy setup."
   - How to trigger: Misconfigured proxy or direct API access without CORS

Invalid Request (400):
   - Message: "Invalid request: [brief description]"
   - How to trigger: Backend validation failure

These can be captured as supplementary screenshots if documentation requires
showing multiple error types.

================================================================================
11. QUALITY CHECKLIST
================================================================================

Before finalizing the screenshot, verify:

[ ] Error message text is completely visible and readable
[ ] No text is cut off or truncated
[ ] Error card borders and styling are clearly visible
[ ] Color contrast meets accessibility standards
[ ] Technical Details section toggle is visible
[ ] Form area shows that a submission was attempted
[ ] No personal or sensitive information visible
[ ] Browser chrome is cropped out (screenshot page only)
[ ] File size is optimized for web use
[ ] Image dimensions match documentation requirements

================================================================================
12. NOTES FOR MAINTAINERS
================================================================================

When updating this screenshot:

- Regenerate if UI design changes significantly
- Verify error messages match current implementation
- Test that documented steps still reproduce the error state
- Update this placeholder if capture instructions change
- Coordinate with troubleshooting.md content updates

For questions about error handling implementation, refer to:
   - frontend/src/components/ErrorDisplay.tsx
