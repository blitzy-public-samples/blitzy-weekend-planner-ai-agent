SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: plan-raw-output.png
=============================================================================

FILE PURPOSE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a placeholder file for the plan-raw-output.png screenshot. The actual
PNG image should be captured following the instructions below and saved with
the same filename (replacing this .txt file extension with .png).

This screenshot shows a successfully generated weekend plan with the Raw
Output section EXPANDED to display the full JSON response from the ADK
backend. It is intended for technical users and advanced documentation.


SCREENSHOT CAPTURE INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Goal: Capture a screenshot showing a generated plan with the Raw Output
section EXPANDED, displaying the underlying JSON response structure.

This screenshot builds on the plan-result.png state but with the additional
Raw Output panel visible and open.


HOW TO CAPTURE THIS STATE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Prerequisites:
   - Ensure the ADK backend is running (execute `adk web` in terminal)
   - Open the Weekend Planner frontend at http://localhost:5173
   - Clear browser cache and use incognito/private mode for consistency

2. Generate a Plan:
   - Fill the form with sample data:
     * Location: "San Francisco, CA" or "94102"
     * Start Date: An upcoming Saturday
     * End Date: The following Sunday
     * Kids Ages: "5, 10"
     * Preferences: "outdoor activities, family-friendly"
   - Click the "Generate Plan" button
   - Wait for the plan to load successfully

3. Expand Raw Output:
   - Locate the "Raw Output" collapsible section below the plan summary
   - Click the toggle/button to EXPAND the Raw Output section
   - The JSON content should now be visible

4. Position for Screenshot:
   - Scroll the page to show both the plan summary AND the raw output
   - Ensure meaningful JSON content is visible in the viewport
   - May need to adjust scroll position for optimal content display


VISUAL ELEMENTS TO INCLUDE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The screenshot should clearly show:

1. Plan Result Summary (at top):
   - The generated weekend plan recommendations
   - Activity suggestions and summary text
   - Weather-aware content if displayed

2. Raw Output Section Header:
   - "Raw Output" section title/label
   - Toggle indicator showing "expanded" state (e.g., chevron pointing down)
   - Visual distinction from main plan content

3. JSON Response Block:
   - Preformatted JSON in a code/monospace block
   - Visible JSON fields should include:
     * "id" - Event unique identifier
     * "timestamp" - ISO8601 timestamp
     * "author" - Shows "model" for AI responses
     * "content" - Contains parts array with text
   - Scrollable container if content is lengthy

4. ADK Response Structure:
   The JSON should reflect the ADK event-based response format:
   ```
   [
     {
       "id": "event_xxx",
       "timestamp": "2024-XX-XXTXX:XX:XX.XXXZ",
       "author": "model",
       "content": {
         "parts": [{ "text": "..." }],
         "role": "model"
       }
     },
     ...
   ]
   ```


JSON DISPLAY ELEMENTS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ensure the following display characteristics are visible:

- Monospace/code font for JSON content (e.g., Consolas, Monaco, monospace)
- Proper indentation showing nested structure (2-space or 4-space indent)
- Line breaks between JSON objects for readability
- Syntax highlighting if implemented in the component:
  * String values in one color
  * Property keys in another color
  * Brackets/braces clearly visible
- Scroll position showing meaningful content:
  * Include at least one complete event object
  * Show nested "content" and "parts" structure
  * Capture the author "model" field if possible


RECOMMENDED BROWSER SETTINGS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Browser: Chrome, Firefox, or Safari (latest version)
- Window width: 1200px for desktop two-column layout
- Viewport height: May need 900px+ to capture both summary and raw output
- Scroll position: Show both plan summary at top and raw output below
- DevTools: Closed (or use a separate window)
- Cache: Clear before capture
- Mode: Incognito/Private for consistent styling
- Zoom level: 100%
- Color scheme: Light mode (default)

Network Settings (if needed to slow down for capture):
- Use DevTools Network tab
- Disable throttling for this capture (want successful result)


FILE NAMING CONVENTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Filename: plan-raw-output.png
Format: PNG
Resolution: 2x recommended for retina/high-DPI displays
Dimensions: Capture the full visible area showing both elements
Quality: Lossless PNG format for text clarity

If capturing at 2x resolution:
- Set browser zoom to 100%
- Use OS screenshot tools or browser DevTools for device pixel ratio


REFERENCE IN DOCUMENTATION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This screenshot is used in the following documentation files:

1. user-guide.md
   - Section: "Viewing Raw Output" or "For Technical Users"
   - Context: Shows how to expand the raw output for debugging
   - Caption suggestion: "Clicking 'Raw Output' reveals the full JSON response"

2. troubleshooting.md
   - Section: "Debugging API Responses"
   - Context: Helps users inspect actual API response for issues
   - Caption suggestion: "Expand Raw Output to see the complete server response"

Target Audience:
- Technical users who want to see the underlying API response
- Developers debugging issues with plan generation
- Users curious about how the AI response is structured


SCREENSHOT CHECKLIST

Before saving the screenshot, verify:

[ ] Plan summary is visible at the top of the output panel
[ ] "Raw Output" section is EXPANDED (not collapsed)

ACCESSIBILITY NOTES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When capturing this screenshot, note that the actual component should have:
- aria-expanded attribute on the toggle button
- Proper focus indicators if keyboard-navigated
- Screen reader announcement of expanded/collapsed state

The screenshot documentation should describe these accessibility features
for users who may not be able to see the visual representation.


ALTERNATIVE CAPTURE METHODS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Method 1: Browser Screenshot
- Use keyboard shortcut (Cmd+Shift+4 on Mac, Win+Shift+S on Windows)

Method 2: DevTools Capture
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Click the device toolbar icon
- Set a custom viewport size
- Use "Capture screenshot" from the menu (three dots)

Method 3: Browser Extension
- Use a screenshot extension like "Full Page Screen Capture"
- Capture only the visible viewport
- Crop to focus on the raw output area

Method 4: Design Tool
- Use Figma, Sketch, or similar to capture from browser
- Helpful for adding annotations or highlights later
