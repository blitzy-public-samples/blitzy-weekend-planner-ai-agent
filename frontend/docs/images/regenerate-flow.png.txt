================================================================================

FILE PURPOSE
------------
This is a placeholder file for the regenerate-flow.png screenshot. The actual
PNG image should be captured and saved to replace this text file. This
screenshot documents the workflow for regenerating or resetting a plan in the
Weekend Planner application.


SCREENSHOT CAPTURE INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------
This screenshot should demonstrate the regenerate/reset workflow - showing how
users can start over or create a new plan after viewing results. This may be
captured as a single screenshot or as a composite image showing the flow.


CAPTURE OPTIONS
---------------

Option A - Single Screenshot with Reset Button Focus:
  • Show the application after a plan has been successfully generated
  • Highlight or draw attention to the "Reset" button
  • Form fields should still contain the previously entered data
  • Output panel shows the generated plan
  • User can see both their input and the option to start fresh

Option B - Before/After Composite Image:
  • LEFT SIDE: Application with generated plan and filled form
    - Shows successful state with plan visible
    - Form contains user's original input data
    - Both "Generate Plan" and "Reset" buttons visible
  • RIGHT SIDE: Application after Reset clicked (empty state)
    - All form fields cleared
    - Output panel shows empty state message
    - "Generate Plan" button disabled
  • Include an arrow or visual indicator showing the transition flow

Option C - Regenerate Action Screenshot:
  • Form fields with MODIFIED values (different from original submission)
  • Previous plan still visible in output panel
  • Cursor/highlight on "Generate Plan" button ready to be clicked
  • Shows user can adjust inputs and generate a new plan


VISUAL ELEMENTS TO INCLUDE
--------------------------
  • "Reset" button - secondary/ghost style with outline
    - Should be clearly visible and identifiable
    - Located near the form submission area

    - Shows the option to generate again with modified inputs
  
  • Form fields with data entered:
    - Location field populated
    - Start and End date fields filled
    - Optional fields (Kids Ages, Preferences) may be filled
  
  • Visual indication that regeneration/reset is possible:
    - Clear UI affordances for starting over
    - User path forward is obvious


USER FLOW BEING DOCUMENTED
--------------------------
This screenshot illustrates the following user journey:

1. User has already generated a weekend plan successfully
2. User wants to either:
   a) Modify their input and generate a different plan
   b) Clear everything and start completely fresh
3. User has two options available:
   a) Click "Reset" → Clears all form fields and output
   b) Modify form fields → Click "Generate Plan" again for new results
4. Both workflows return the user to a state where they can plan again


STEP-BY-STEP CAPTURE INSTRUCTIONS

2. For Option A (Reset Focus):
   - Position browser window to show both form and output
   - Use browser annotation tool or screenshot editor to highlight Reset button
   - Capture screenshot showing the full interface

3. For Option B (Before/After Composite):
   - Capture "before" screenshot with plan visible
   - Click "Reset" button
   - Capture "after" screenshot showing cleared state
   - Use image editing software to create side-by-side composite

   - Change location to a different city
   - Update dates or kids ages
