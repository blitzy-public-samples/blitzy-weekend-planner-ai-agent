SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: loading-state.png
================================================================================

FILE PURPOSE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a placeholder file for the loading-state.png screenshot. When the actual
screenshot is captured, it should replace this placeholder file with the PNG
image. This file contains instructions for documentation maintainers on how to
properly capture the loading state screenshot.

================================================================================
SCREENSHOT CAPTURE INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
Capture a screenshot of the Weekend Planner application during plan generation.
This shows the loading state immediately after the user clicks "Generate Plan".
The loading state transitions quickly to results, so capture timing is critical.

WHAT THIS SCREENSHOT DEMONSTRATES
---------------------------------
- The visual feedback users see while waiting for AI to generate their plan
- Skeleton loading animations indicating processing
- The loading message providing user reassurance
- Application responsiveness during API calls

================================================================================
HOW TO TRIGGER LOADING STATE
================================================================================

STANDARD METHOD
---------------
1. Start the ADK backend server: Run `adk web` from the repository root
2. Start the frontend: Run `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Open the application at http://localhost:5173
4. Fill out the form with valid data:
   - Location: "San Francisco, CA" or "94102"
   - Start Date: Select an upcoming Saturday
   - End Date: Select the following Sunday
   - Kids Ages: "5, 10" (optional)
   - Preferences: "outdoor activities" (optional)
5. Click the "Generate Plan" button
6. IMMEDIATELY capture the screenshot while loading state is visible
7. The loading state typically lasts 2-10 seconds depending on API response time

ALTERNATIVE METHOD (EXTENDED CAPTURE WINDOW)
--------------------------------------------
To capture the loading state more easily, use browser developer tools to
throttle the network:

1. Open Chrome/Edge DevTools (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
2. Go to the "Network" tab
3. Click the throttling dropdown (usually shows "No throttling")
4. Select "Slow 3G" to significantly slow down API responses
5. This gives you a much longer window to capture the loading state
6. Perform the standard method steps 3-6 above
7. Remember to disable throttling after capture

================================================================================
VISUAL ELEMENTS TO INCLUDE
================================================================================

REQUIRED ELEMENTS
-----------------
- Loading skeleton cards with pulse animation
  * Multiple skeleton cards should be visible
  * Cards should have a subtle animated "shimmer" or "pulse" effect
  * Skeleton elements represent where plan content will appear

- Loading message: "Creating your perfect weekend..."
  * This message should be clearly visible
  * Text should be centered or prominently placed

- Form area visible (may appear disabled/dimmed)
  * The input form should still be in view on the left side (desktop)
  * Form fields may appear slightly dimmed or disabled during loading

- Animated loading indicator
  * Skeleton pulse animation should be captured mid-animation
  * Visual indication that processing is in progress

LAYOUT REFERENCE
----------------
- Desktop (≥768px): Two-column layout
  * Left column (40%): Form area (may be dimmed)
  * Right column (60%): Loading skeleton and message
- Mobile (<768px): Single stacked column
  * Form above loading area

COLOR REFERENCE
---------------
- Background: #F4F1DE (warm cream)
- Skeleton elements: Light gray with animated pulse
- Text color: #3D405B (deep charcoal)
- Loading message may use primary color: #E07A5F (soft coral)

================================================================================
ACCESSIBILITY ELEMENTS TO NOTE
================================================================================

The loading state should demonstrate proper accessibility implementation:

- The loading container should have aria-busy="true" attribute
  * This communicates loading state to screen readers
  * Assistive technologies announce that content is loading

- Proper loading announcement for screen readers
  * The "Creating your perfect weekend..." text serves as announcement

- No focus traps during loading
  * Users should still be able to navigate the page

Note: These accessibility features won't be visible in the screenshot, but
ensure the application is properly implementing them when capturing.

================================================================================
ANIMATION CAPTURE TIPS
================================================================================

TIMING THE CAPTURE
------------------
- Capture at peak of pulse animation for best visual effect
- The pulse animation typically cycles every 1-2 seconds
- Watch for the moment when skeleton elements are at brightest/most visible

MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS
-----------------
- Multiple screenshots may be needed to get the best frame
- Take several screenshots in quick succession during loading
- Review and select the one with most visible animation effect

SCREEN RECORDING APPROACH
-------------------------
If timing is difficult:
1. Use screen recording software (QuickTime, OBS, or browser extension)
2. Record the entire loading sequence
3. Export as video and extract the best frame as PNG
4. This ensures you capture the perfect moment of the animation

BROWSER BUILT-IN RECORDING
--------------------------
Chrome DevTools has a built-in recorder:
1. Open DevTools → Performance tab
2. Click "Start profiling and reload page"
3. Perform the action and stop recording
4. Screenshots are captured in the filmstrip view
5. Right-click any frame to save as image

================================================================================
RECOMMENDED BROWSER SETTINGS
================================================================================

WINDOW CONFIGURATION
--------------------
- Browser: Chrome, Edge, or Firefox (latest version)
- Window width: 1200px for desktop view
- This ensures both form and loading area are visible in two-column layout
- For mobile view variant: Set window width to 375px

NETWORK SETTINGS
----------------
- Network throttling: "Slow 3G" for longer capture window
- Alternatively: Use no throttling and capture quickly
- Connection to ADK backend must be active

BROWSER STATE
-------------
- Clear browser cache before capture
- Clear localStorage and sessionStorage
- Use incognito/private mode for consistent styling
- Disable browser extensions that might affect appearance

DISPLAY SETTINGS
----------------
- Recommended display scale: 100%
- For retina/HiDPI displays: Capture at 2x resolution
- Ensure no OS-level zoom is applied

================================================================================
FILE NAMING CONVENTION
================================================================================

OUTPUT FILE
-----------
- File name: loading-state.png
- Format: PNG (preferred for UI screenshots)
- Do not use JPEG (lossy compression affects text quality)

RESOLUTION GUIDELINES
---------------------
- Standard display: 1200px width minimum
- Retina/HiDPI: 2400px width (2x resolution)
- Recommended: Capture at 2x and provide both standard and @2x versions

FILE SIZE
---------
- Optimize PNG after capture using tools like ImageOptim or TinyPNG
- Target file size: Under 500KB for web performance
- Maintain image quality - don't over-compress

================================================================================
REFERENCE IN DOCUMENTATION
================================================================================

This screenshot will be used in the following documentation files:

GETTING STARTED GUIDE
---------------------
Location: frontend/docs/getting-started.md
Section: Step 7 - Wait while AI creates your plan
Context: Shows what users see immediately after clicking Generate Plan

USER GUIDE
----------
Location: frontend/docs/user-guide.md
Section: Generating Your Plan
Context: Explains the loading state and what to expect during processing

USAGE EXAMPLE
-------------
In Markdown documentation:

```markdown
After clicking "Generate Plan", you'll see a loading indicator:

![Loading State](./images/loading-state.png)

The AI is analyzing your preferences and researching activities. This
typically takes a few seconds.
```
