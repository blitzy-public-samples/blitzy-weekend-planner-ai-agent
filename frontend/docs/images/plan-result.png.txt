SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: plan-result.png
================================================================================

FILE PURPOSE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a placeholder file for the plan-result.png screenshot. This screenshot
shows the primary "success state" of the Weekend Planner application - a
successfully generated weekend plan with activity recommendations displayed
in the PlanView component.

This is one of the most important screenshots in the documentation as it shows
users what to expect when they successfully generate a weekend plan.


SCREENSHOT CAPTURE INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Capture a screenshot showing a successfully generated weekend plan
2. This is the primary "success state" screenshot for documentation
3. Shows the PlanView component with activity recommendations
4. Ensure the entire output panel is visible with meaningful content


HOW TO GENERATE A GOOD RESULT
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prerequisites:
- Ensure ADK backend is running with: adk web
- Frontend development server running with: npm run dev
- Navigate to http://localhost:5173 in your browser

Fill the form with engaging sample data:
- Location: "San Francisco, CA" or another major city with activities
- Start Date: Upcoming Saturday (use actual date picker)
- End Date: Following Sunday (one day after start date)
- Kids Ages: "5, 10" (provides age-appropriate recommendations)
- Preferences: "outdoor activities, family-friendly, parks"

Execution:
- Click the "Generate Plan" button
- Wait for the loading state to complete (may take 10-30 seconds)
- Plan results will appear in the output panel


VISUAL ELEMENTS TO INCLUDE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The screenshot should clearly show:

1. Plan Summary/Title Area:
   - Header showing the destination area
   - Weather status indicator
   - Age information for the kids

2. Weather-Aware Recommendations:
   - The plan adapts based on weather forecast
   - If weather is "good" - outdoor activities featured
   - If weather is "bad" or "do not leave home" - indoor activities featured

3. Activity Categories (when weather permits outdoor activities):
   - Local activities findings (3-4 family activities in the area)
   - Special events findings (festivals, fairs, community events)
   
4. Activity Categories (when weather requires staying home):
   - Home activities (creative, building, science projects)

5. Final Summary Section:
   - Bulleted list with 3-5 key recommendations
   - Explanations for why each activity was chosen
   - Friendly header showing area, weather, and ages

6. Disclaimer Text:
   - Visible at the bottom of the plan
   - States results are AI-generated and need verification

7. Collapsible "Raw Output" Section:
   - Should be COLLAPSED (not expanded) in this screenshot
   - Toggle button visible but content hidden
   - This shows users where to find technical details if needed

8. Success Styling:
   - Sage green accents (#81B29A) if applicable to success elements
   - Warm cream background (#F4F1DE) 
   - Deep charcoal text (#3D405B) for readability


CONTENT QUALITY GUIDELINES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before capturing, ensure:

- Wait for a response that shows varied recommendations
- Plan text should be fully loaded (no loading indicators visible)
- All text should be readable and not truncated
- Plan should show multiple activity suggestions (3-5 minimum)
- Disclaimer text must be visible at the bottom
- If the first response is poor quality, click "Reset" and try again
- Avoid capturing error states or partial loading states


RECOMMENDED BROWSER SETTINGS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Browser Window:
- Width: 1200px minimum (to show desktop two-column layout)
- Height: Sufficient to show key content without excessive scrolling
- Zoom level: 100%

Layout Verification:
- Form should appear in left 40% column
- Output panel should appear in right 60% column
- Both columns should be clearly visible

Before Capture:
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Use incognito/private mode for consistent styling
- Disable browser extensions that might alter appearance
- Ensure no console/DevTools panels are open

Scroll Position:
- Scroll to show the most meaningful content
- Plan header and first few activities should be visible
- Consider capturing multiple screenshots if content is long


FILE NAMING CONVENTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Save as: plan-result.png
Format: PNG (for crisp text rendering)
Resolution: 2x for retina displays (recommended)
Color depth: 24-bit or 32-bit color

If capturing on a retina/HiDPI display:
- Native resolution will provide 2x quality automatically
- Alternatively, manually export at 2x scale

File size guidance:
- Aim for under 500KB if possible
- Use PNG optimization tools if needed


REFERENCE IN DOCUMENTATION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This screenshot is referenced in the following documentation files:

1. frontend/docs/getting-started.md
   - Section: Step 8 - Review suggestions
   - Shows users what a successful result looks like

2. frontend/docs/user-guide.md
   - Section: Understanding Your Results
   - Explains the different parts of the plan output

3. frontend/docs/README.md
   - Section: Screenshots
   - Listed in the documentation index

When updating this screenshot, ensure all references remain accurate and
the visual matches what is described in the documentation text.


ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS TO CONSIDER
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This screenshot shows the standard success state. Related screenshots include:

- plan-raw-output.png: Shows the Raw Output section EXPANDED
- loading-state.png: Shows the loading animation before results appear
- error-state.png: Shows what happens when plan generation fails

Ensure this screenshot clearly differs from those by showing:
- Completed plan (not loading)
- No errors
- Raw Output collapsed (not expanded)


TROUBLESHOOTING
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you cannot generate a good result:

1. Backend not responding:
   - Verify ADK server is running: adk web
   - Check terminal for errors
   - Ensure Google API credentials are configured

2. Poor quality results:
   - Try different locations (major cities work better)
   - Use specific age ranges (e.g., "5, 10" rather than "2, 17")
   - Add preferences for better targeting

3. CORS errors:
   - Ensure Vite proxy is configured correctly
   - Check vite.config.ts for proxy settings
   - Verify frontend is running on port 5173

4. Timeout errors:
   - AI generation can take 10-30 seconds
   - Wait for full response before capturing
   - If timeout persists, check backend logs
